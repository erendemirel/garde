# Secrets Directory
#
# This directory is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY.
# In production, /run/secrets is a tmpfs mount populated by Vault Agent.
#
# NEVER commit actual secrets to this repository.
#
# Architecture:
#   Vault Server → Vault Agent → tmpfs (/run/secrets) → garde app                                     
#                                 
#
# The app watches /run/secrets for changes and auto reloads.
# Redis connections are automatically refreshed when credentials rotate.
#
# Required secrets:
#   redis_host, redis_port, redis_password
#   domain_name, superuser_email, api_key
#
# See vault/agent-config.hcl for Vault Agent configuration.
